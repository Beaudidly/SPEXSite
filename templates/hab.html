						<h2>High Altitude Balloon</h2>

					</header>
          <p> The SPEX High Altitude Balloon (HAB) project/group allows for a unique opportunity to
              conduct experiments for our Cubesat in a near space-like environment. HABs typically
              reach an attitude of aproximately 30,000 meters (about 100,000 feet). SPEX HAB has
              launched two previous balloons, designated as HAB I and HAB II.
          </p>
          <p> The relative low cost and fast turn around of HABs provides a great way for SPEX
              members to gain hands-on experience in a field they are interested in. Examples of this
              are desigin flight software, flight hardware, payload bus, and other payload concepts.

              </header>
                  <p>HAB II was launched on May 8th, 2016 from the North side of RIT's campus. The main payload of the HAB was testing a Senior Design Project for Anthony Hennig. The basis of the project was a deployment system of spring hinged solar panels on a CubeSat.</p>
                  <p>After launch, the HAB team retreated to observe
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">
                          APRS </a> reports on the location and altitude of HAB II. After reaching
                      an altitude of approximately 29,500m, the balloon burst, starting the descent back to Earth's surface.
                      HAB II utilized a parachute deployed between the balloon and payload, activated by wind resistance when
                      falling.

                  <h2>HAB I</h2>
              </header>
              <p>The group first began work on the project during the fall of 2015 as an initiative
                  to get undergraduates working with real flight-components. Launching the first balloon
                  required the team to overcome a series of hurtles, the first of which is funding.
                  Through one our advisors we were able to use leftover money from RIT’s
                  <a href="http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/electrical/meteor/meteor/Home.html">Project METEOR</a>.
                  This project, which ran during the early 2000’s, was developing a system to place
                  lightweight satellites into low earth orbit by launching a small rocket off a high altitude
                  balloon from an altitude greater than 80,000 feet. This project shutdown after one of the
                  lead advisers left RIT. Funding from that program was able to kick start our project, but
                  we were also able to raise over $2,500 through our own crowdfunding campaign in December 2015.

                  The flight camera was a GoPro Hero 3+ with the standard waterproof case. The camera was set to
                  take a photograph every ten seconds and store it on a 32 GB SD Card. 671 photos were taken, so
                  the camera lasted approximately two hours before the battery died. The camera was mounted
                  sideways in the cooler with a wooden chopstick holding it into the styrofoam. A hand warmer
                  was placed on the outside of the case to keep the battery warm.
