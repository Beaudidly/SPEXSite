          <p> The SPEX High Altitude Balloon (HAB) project/group allows for a unique opportunity to conduct experiments for our Cubesat in a near space-like environment. HABs typically reach an attitude of aproximately 30,000 meters (about 100,000 feet). SPEX HAB has launched two previous balloons, designated as HAB I and HAB II.</p>
