            <h2>Cold Gad Propulsion Analysis and Design</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The Cold Gas Propulsion Analysis and Design (CGPAD) team concerns the design, fabrication, and
            experimentation of a cold gas thruster. The projectâ€™s main goal is to provide insight and
            experience into the design of a supersonic nozzle for small propulsion systems. Secondary goals
            will include the understanding in the design of high-pressure flow systems,
            including the necessary precautions and procedures to ensure safe usage.

        <h3>Our Propulsion System</h3>
        <p>
            Our propulsion system includes a regular, a solenoid, a tank, a nozzle, piping and interfaces
            all connected in series. The test stand includes a t-slot frame made entirely of aluminum.
            There is also an connected Arduino which will record the data from the load cell.
